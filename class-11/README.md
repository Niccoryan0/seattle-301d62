# Server-side templating with EJS

## Feedback From Week 2

- partners starting code challenge during lunch
- agreeing to a code challenge end time has worked wonders
- The api's were really hard
- Starting to realize the applications of the code challenge for the lab. Also like the review aspects of question 1.
- "I like how our class is collaborating together in remo." <3
- "I love the WRRC graphic representations of what is going on. "
- "I have made a breakthrough in seeing some larger chunks of code rather than staring at tiny little bits. "

## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Full-stack application skeleton scaffolding
- HTML5 Forms
- Server-side templating
- Google Books API
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:

- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library
